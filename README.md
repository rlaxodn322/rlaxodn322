### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹


Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Taewoo Kim, a full-stack developer based in Korea.

ðŸ”­ I have worked on various projects, including an electric vehicle monitoring platform, an electric bus project, mobile wedding invitations, an e-commerce marketplace, to-do list applications, restaurant discovery maps, emotional diary apps, and weather apps. Currently, I'm actively involved in a connected wheelchair integrated monitoring platform.

ðŸš€ I predominantly utilize a tech stack that includes React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Node.js (Express.js, Nest.js).

ðŸŒ± I am committed to continuous learning and exploring new technologies to enhance my skills and contribute more to the development community.

ðŸ’¬ I have a keen interest in AWS, projects, and programming languages, and I am currently studying Spring.
