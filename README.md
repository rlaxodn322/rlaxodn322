Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Taewoo Kim, a full-stack developer based in Korea.

ðŸ”­ I have participated in various projects including a chat platform, a stray dog information platform, a place search platform, a weather information platform, a car ferry monitoring platform, an electric bus project, mobile wedding invitations, an e-commerce marketplace, a to-do list application, a restaurant discovery map, an emotional diary app, and more. Currently, I am actively contributing to an integrated monitoring platform for electric wheelchairs.

ðŸš€ I predominantly utilize a tech stack that includes React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Node.js (Express.js, Nest.js). These days, I particularly enjoy using NestJS and recognize the importance of writing unit tests and making it a habit.

ðŸŒ± I am dedicated to continuous learning and exploring new technologies to enhance my skills and make greater contributions to the development community.

ðŸ’¬ I have a keen interest in cloud technologies like AWS, project management, and various programming languages.<br><br>
