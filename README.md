### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Taewoo Kim, a passionate developer based in Korea.

ðŸ”­ I've embarked on various projects including mobile wedding invitations, e-commerce marketplace, to-do list applications, restaurant discovery maps, emotional diary apps, weather apps, and currently, I'm actively involved in an electric bus project.

ðŸš€ I predominantly utilize a tech stack comprising React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Node.js (Express.js).

ðŸŒ± I'm dedicated to continuous learning and exploration of new technologies to enhance my skills and make greater contributions to the development community.
